## Hi there, I'm Sai Preethi Poka! ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about using data to uncover insights, test ideas, and solve meaningful problems. My interests span product experimentation, analytics, and machine learning, with a growing curiosity in causal inference. I enjoy working across domains, from product and user behavior to market and operational analysis to drive smarter, evidence-based decisions.
